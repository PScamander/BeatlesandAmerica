# BeatlesandAmerica
The Beatles had been a sweeping cultural phenomenon on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, with their fans still worshipping their glory 46 years after they split up. The roaring tide, coined by the press ‘Beatlemania’, sailed out from Liverpool, all the way across the Oceans, finally washed over America. This was coined the British invasion of American Popular music, however, I argue that the Beatles did not simply ‘invade’ the US. Quite the contrary, they have a much more complicated history with the United States of America.

The Beatles’ music has its root in American music and the members had more to do with America than merely being across the Atlantic. When they did arrived in America in 1964, the loving fans were not the only ones who stood waiting. There were many US people who frowned at the idea that they would ever set foot on the American soil.  

Growing up across the ocean from America, the four Beatles grew up listening to American rock 'n' roll music and the local skiffle acts influenced by country-and-western music from America . John Lennon, the Beatle who eventually spent the last years of his life in America, said later in his life: “In Liverpool, when you stood on the edge of the water you knew the next place was America" .  The wonders of the world that came all the way across the waters from America - Brando, the beat poets, Buddy Holly, Elvis Presley, Muddy Waters... they had long since fallen under their spell.   

The evidence of American influence on the Beatles’ music is prominent. The first ever artist that captured John’s attention was Elvis Presley . The song instantly lighted up the musical sparks in him and he would go on and write many songs inspired by Presley and his Rock’n’Roll songs in the early 1960s. He recalled with immense admiration and enthusiasm:’ “Nothing really affected me until Elvis  and Heartbreak Hotel” “was the most exciting thing [we’d] ever heard .” Therefore, it was no surprise that the first song he ever played was “Ain’t That a Shame,” the American singer Fats Domino’s first hit and that they would later pay tribute to him in their song “Lady Madonna” . 

Paul McCartney, the most active Beatle today, was also deeply immersed in American music in his early days. Indeed, like John, Paul’s musical inspiration came from the United States as well. 

He fell under the spell of Rock’n’Roll in his teenage years and he loved the improvisational aspect of it, and he loved mimicking its exaggerated nuances.  His early musical explorations in American Rock’n’Roll was filled with the names like Buddy Holly and Elvis, Chuck Berry, and even Carl Perkins—they had the magic that enthralled him more than anything, a captivating power that inspired him to purchase a guitar and start composing amazing song. When Paul McCartney first encountered Lennon at a church social event in 1957, he provided his new friend with the words to Eddie Cochran’s “Twenty Flight Rock” and Gene Vincent’s “Be-bop-a-Lula”, both hit songs in the US at that time. "Long Tall Sally", a hit by American singer Little Richard, was "The first number Paul ever sang on stage" . Bob Spitz once commented: “He wanted to sound how they sounded, look how they looked, and play how they played.”  This had indeed been an understatement of how Paul felt about American music.

Their musical composition was also under great influence of American Rock’n’Roll music. Their early songs, notably ‘One After 909’, ‘I Saw Her Standing There’ and ‘Hello Little Girl’ have very similar structure, chord progression and playing style with songs by Elvis Presley, Little Richard and Buddy Holly from that era. Though the Beatles were soon able to establish their own styles and went on to be one of the most successful and influential pop acts of all time, they had never really forgotten how immersed they were in the oldies that changed their life. John released Rock 'n' Roll, an album of late 1950s and early 1960s songs as covered by him in 1975 and Paul also released Choba B CCCP (also known as The Russian Album) in 1988 which consists entirely of covers, mainly of rock and roll oldies. Two albums, while showing great nostalgia for the days that they enjoyed with those golden oldies, were, at the same time, loving glances backwards at their youth with American rock and roll oldies, with Elvis, Little Richard, and other great rock and rollers from across the Atlantic.

In 1964, however, the Beatles, after years of education from American music, were finally leaving Britain for the US tour. According to his ex-wife, Cynthia Lennon, John had “been over the moon at the prospect”  of the visit. They were there to give would-be legendary concerts in the land of his forefathers: Chuck, Elvis, and Buddy   . When the 707 with the Beatles on board landed in New York City, they were welcomed by an overwhelming crowd burning with excitement. The New York Times reported that “three thousand teenagers stood four deep on the upper arcade of the International Arrivals Building… girls, girls and more girls.” As an official at the gate exclaimed, it was “Not even for kings or queens,”  They were soon flying across the continent with the “Beatlemania” sweeping along with them, but before all this great success, there were, of course, people in the US who did not fancy them coming to the States. After their first US tour, the INS and the US Department of Labor acted on behest of the American Federation of Musicians (AFM) - the union that represents professional musicians in the US - to prevent the Beatles from returning to the US after their debut tour in January and February.  The Beatles’ fans were furious over the attempt, writing very emotional letters to Herman Kenin, then President of the AFM, complaining about their decision. Bonnie Wilkins, a teenage rock and roll enthusiast from Scottsdale, Arizona, wrote: “You really have a lot of nerve, trying to keep them out of the United States, but if you can brainwash the authorities into doing it, you can just say good-bye to us teenagers - we're all moving to England. And to think that all this time we thought that America was a free country . . . sometimes we wonder.” 

The case ended with the Beatles and their fans’ victory, but was much more than merely the victory of a music group and the groupies. It also foreshadowed the cultural conflict between the American bureaucracy and the counter-culture that emerged in the late 1960s , and a very important prelude to the counterculture movement in the 1960s as well. The Beatles’ influence on American culture of that era, however, extended beyond merely a legal case. They were the creators of psychedelic rock, and the face of the hippy movement of that era. The hippie culture was closely connected with drugs and popular music and hippies largely contributed to, if not started, the sexual revolution by promoting free love.  They brought new awareness and many social-political and cultural changes in the United States and abroad. Hippies questioned popular values and beliefs, and so did The Beatles. They professed ideas of peace, love, pacifism, ecology, civil rights, gay rights, and freedom and so did The Beatles. In just a few years, hippies had followers allover the world. Hence, in America the label "hippy" or "hippie" is a synonym of "a social reformer", "free thinker" and also a "user of mind-expanding psychedelic drugs" such as marihuana or LSD that The Beatles also wrote songs about, for example "Day Tripper" - about LSD trip.   When John Lennon was asked whether songs like "Give Peace a Chance" and "Power to the People" were propaganda songs, he answered: "Sure. So was 'All You Need Is Love'. I'm a revolutionary artist. My art is dedicated to change."  This courageous remark summed up the Beatles’ effort in the 1960s counterculture movement in the best way.

Successful as they were in the US, the Beatles did not always have a good time with their revered forefathers of rock and roll. The historical summit between the two megastars was not entirely cheerful. After a brief, embarrassing silence brought by, as Paul put it, “hero worship of a high degree,”  they soon knew more about Presley, and John had, by then, ‘slipped from feather to thistle’  Beyond the faux French accent, John chided Elvis rudely—and in front of his pals, no less—about his lack of chops, the post-army soft-core singles, and string of cornball movies.  John concluded the meeting as “a load of rubbish, ” showing a very mixed feeling towards his childhood hero.

The Beatles’ feeling towards America and American music can be clearly seen through their meeting with Presley. He was their forefather, the inspiration of their musical composition and the one who changed their lives, but he was also, at the same time, representing the establishment and stagnation. They had longed to be face to face with him, to talk to him, but they grew up and did sit with him face to face, they found him disappointing. So was the case with America. They grew up listening to American music and wondering about how it would be like in America, but when they arrived after years of hard work, they found that it was not the perfect place they once thought it was. Therefore, they carried on with their ideals and composed songs that influenced the course of human history, and of course, America. 

In conclusion, the Beatles’ relationship with the US was a very subtle and complicated one and they did not simply ‘invade’ the US. They were deeply influenced by American culture, and they, in turn, influenced American culture themselves. They were enthralled by America but still repulsed by certain aspects of it. American teenagers adored them, but the establishment in the US did not welcome them as warmly. It was precisely this complicated relationship that made the Beatles’ stories in America so captivating and exciting, which will go on to inspire countless young musicians in days to come.
